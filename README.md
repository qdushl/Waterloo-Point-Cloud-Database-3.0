# Waterloo-Point-Cloud-Database-3.0  
This database was created by Qi Liu (sdqi.liu@gmail.com) and Honglei Su (suhonglei@qdu.edu.cn) from Qingdao University in 2021. We welcome everyone to carry on the test and propose the modification opinion. If you use our database ***************************** (a Google account required) in your paper, please cite our paper:

The WPC3.0 database is composed of 350 V-PCC distorted point clouds and corresponding bitstreams whose original point clouds (Biscuits, Cake, Cauliflower, Litchi, Ping-pong_bat, Puertea, Pumpkin, Ship, Statue, Toolbox, Coffeecup, Crois-sant, Saltbox, Honeydewmelon) are from the WPC database https://github.com/qdushl/Waterloo-Point-Cloud-Database. Each original point cloud are encoded by 5 geometry (geo) QPs {26,32,38,44,50} and 5 texture (col) QPs {26,32,38,44,50} respectively. The rest of the encoding parameters are set with default values. The subjective test settings and raw data processing are the same as those in the WPC database.
